                        <h4>Milan: A Day of Shopping</h4>
                        <h5>02.05.2019</h5>

                        <p class="blog-intro"> A look into a day in Milan from the perspective of muah. From
                            shopping 'til I dropped to going to see beautiful art to wandering the streets
                            around the Milan Duomo, my day in Milan was, well, amazing.</p>

                    </div>



                    <div class="row">
                        <div class=" col-sm-6 col-md-12 col-lg-4">
                            <p class="blog-post">Nothing and I mean nothing, comes close to my passion for
                                moda, or
                                fashion. I’ve worshipped fashion magazines since I was little, and even when I
                                used to
                                read the tween magazines like J-14, I would immediately flip to the red carpet
                                looks and
                                write blurbs on the side of each outfit of what I liked and hated about them
                                (like
                                someone should really recruit me for Fashion Police because I’m a brutally
                                honest
                                critic.) So to cure my need for retail therapy, I took a solo train day trip to
                                Milan
                                this past Saturday, June 16.
                                My first order of business that day was to look fashionable because I refused to
                                be seen
                                in Milan looking like trash even if I did have to get up early that morning to
                                catch my
                                train. So, I threw on my go-to white tee, a cute black print scarf that I
                                borrowed from
                                my mama and comfy, yet cute Levi’s and my go-to sneaks. And just like that, I
                                was out
                                the door in a brisk walk to my platform.

                            </p>

                        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-12 col-lg-4">
                            <p class="blog-post"> The top of my list: the Milano Cathedral, or Duomo di Milano. And boy,
                                oh boy was she a beaut. I felt like crying, and in fact, I did tear up (don’t judge me,
                                I’m an
                                architectural and design nerd). If you go to Italy and don’t have a deeper
                                appreciation
                                for ornate and PHENOMENAL DOORS afterward, then honestly we can’t be friends
                                because the
                                doors put me in awe of the people that get to live there every day. Honestly, if
                                an
                                Italian family called me up and said, “Hey Lauren, we want to adopt you. Like
                                you can
                                keep your American family, but come live in our Tuscan villa with cool doors for
                                a
                                little bit of money!” I’d be out – a one-way ticket to Italy here I come. Again,
                                don’t
                                judge me. My point is the Milan Cathedral bronze doors were amazing.
                                My next order of business was to walk through the buildings and just wander a
                                bit. Milan
                                is like a way better European New
                                York City, so explore. I found a cute little
                            </p>

                        <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-12 col-lg-4">
                            <p class="blog-post">coffee shop and a cute pizza place that I
                                ate lunch at. Then, I headed toward the fashion district and the Galleria
                                Vittorio
                                Emanuele, where all of the designer stores are and the architecture is amazing.
                                The
                                Galleria is the oldest mall in the world, and it’s breathtaking (it’s also a
                                great place
                                to get shade in the summer because it’s covered). I did a lot of shopping in
                                this area,
                                like a ridiculous amount. Then, I got a Coke slushie to freshen up after I had
                                some
                                pizza and headed to a design museum I had done some research on previously: La
                                Triennale
                                di Milano Museum.
                                The museum was awesome and truly had something for everyone. I enjoyed the
                                furniture
                                design exhibit, the interactive exhibits and their curation of Italian
                                Instagrammers by
                                color and location. The museum cafe is amazing, too. I treated myself to a
                                coffee and a
                                Sicilian cannoli.
